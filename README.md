# flight_Price_prediction
In this project I have developed the flight prediction module using machine learning . I have applied multiple algorithm  such as
"Random Forest Regressor"
"Linear Regression"
"K Neighbors Regressor"
"Random Forest Regressor"
"Decision Tree Regressor"

before developed the module I have analysis the data and got informative insights and visualized the outcomes. firstly import the data using "pandas". also I imported required libraries"numpy","seaborn","matplotlib" .
then handaled the missing data .clean the data ,handling catogorical data, encoding , analyze the data , dependent and independent variable , feature selection , handling outliers, developed the moduled .
In ***"Random Forest Regressor"*** algorithm I got 95% accuracy.
In ***"Linear Regression"*** algorithm I got 61% accuracy.
In ***"K Neighbors Regressor"*** algorithm I got 78% accuracy.
In ***"Random Forest Regressor"*** algorithm I got 95% accuracy.
In ***"Decision Tree Regressor"*** algorithm I got 96% accuracy.
